# SQL Data Warehouse Project - KDRAMA

## Project Description

This project presents an end-to-end analytics workflow applied to the Korean Drama (K-Drama) industry, spanning data preparation in Excel, relational modeling and ingestion in MySQL, advanced SQL analysis, and strategic insight generation for business decision-making.

The work goes beyond descriptive reporting by introducing:

- Year-normalized performance benchmarks
- Network-level quality vs scale evaluation
- Genre specialization and performance analysis
- Reusable analytics infrastructure using SQL views, stored procedures, and triggers

The final output is a decision-support framework designed for content strategy and programming teams at streaming platforms, enabling data-driven partner selection, genre investment planning, and identification of true breakout titles within competitive release-year contexts.
